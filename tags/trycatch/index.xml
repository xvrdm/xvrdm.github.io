      <description>Foreword Just before publishing this article, I read the purrr cheatsheet and realised that what I developed here already exists. Its name is pluck and I definitely suggest that you use it.
 TL;DR This is an attempt to write a R helper function to subset lists that would be as nice as get-in in the functional programming language Clojure. As said above, this is in fact already available in purrr.</description>
