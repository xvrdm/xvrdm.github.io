      <description>Introduction While scraping rental listings, it’s useful to verify that the scripts managed to grab all the offers. This is nice to have on simple fully loaded single page, but even nicer if the rental listings are set up as a infinite scroll page, which seem increasingly popular on real estate websites and require multiple calls from the scraper.
